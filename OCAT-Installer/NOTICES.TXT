You must first agree to the terms of this License. If you agree to the terms of this
License, you may use the Oculus Software Development Kit. If you do not agree to the
terms of this License, then you may not use the Oculus Software Development Kit.

OCULUS SDK LICENSE

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"), 
Oculus VR, LLC ("Oculus") hereby grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, reproduce and redistribute 
(subject to restrictions below) the software contained in this Oculus Rift Software 
Development Kit for PC and/or Oculus Rift Software Development Kit for mobile (individually 
and collectively, "Oculus SDK"), including, but not limited to, the samples, 
headers, LibOVR and VRLib headers, LibOVR and VRLib source and, subject to your 
compliance with Section 3, the headers, libraries and APIs to enable the Platform 
Services. This License is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1 This license grants you the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the Oculus 
SDK to make engines, tools, applications, content, games and demos (collectively and 
generally referred to as "Developer Content") for use on the Oculus approved hardware 
and software products ("Oculus Approved Products") and which may incorporate the Oculus 
SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) the headers, libraries, 
APIs and other tools made available by Oculus to enable the use of Platform Services 
with your Developer Content.

1.2 For the sake of clarification, when you use the Oculus SDK in or with Developer 
Content, you retain all rights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations 
to share or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) to Oculus 
or any third parties; provided, however, Oculus retains all rights to the Oculus SDK 
and the headers, libraries and APIs to the Platform Services and other tools made available 
by Oculus, including those that may be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.3 You agree that as a condition of this License you will design and distribute your Developer 
Content to ensure that your Developer Content and any software required to use your Developer 
Content does not, and you will not, alter or interfere with the normal operation, behavior 
or functionality of the Oculus hardware or software or Oculus Approved Products, including: 
(i) the behavior of the "Oculus button" and "XBox button" implemented by the Oculus system 
software; (ii) any on-screen messages or information; (iii) the behavior of the proximity 
sensor in the Oculus hardware implemented by the Oculus system software; (iv) Oculus 
hardware or software security features; (v) end user's settings; or (vi) the Oculus Flash 
Screen Warnings. You also agree not to commit any act intended to interfere with the normal 
operation of the Oculus hardware or software or Oculus Approved Products, or provide software 
to Oculus users or developers that would induce breach of any Oculus agreements or that contains 
malware, viruses, hacks, bots, Trojan horses, or other malicious code.

1.4 You may not use the Oculus SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this 
License. You may not:

a.	decompile
b.	reverse engineer
c.	disassemble
d.	attempt to derive the source code of the Oculus SDK or any part of the 
        Oculus SDK, or any other software or firmware provided to you by Oculus

(except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law).

REDISTRIBUTION

2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, your license to redistribute and 
sublicense the Oculus SDK is also expressly made subject to the following conditions:

2.1 You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of the 
Oculus SDK in whole for no charge or as part of a for-charge piece of Developer Content;
provided, however, you may only license, sublicense or redistribute the source, binary 
or object code of the Oculus SDK in its entirety. The Oculus SDK (including, but not 
limited to LibOVR and VRLib), and any Developer Content that includes any portion of 
the Oculus SDK, may only be used with Oculus Approved Products and may not be used, 
licensed, or sublicensed to interface with software or hardware or other commercial 
headsets, mobile tablets or phones that are not authorized and approved by Oculus;

2.2 You must include with all such redistributed or sublicensed Oculus SDK code 
the following copyright notice: "Copyright © 2014-2016 Oculus VR, LLC. All rights reserved,"

2.3 You must give any other recipients of the Oculus SDK a copy of this License as such 
recipients, licensees or sublicensees may only use the Oculus SDK subject to the terms 
of this License and such recipient's, licensee's or sublicensee's agreement to and 
acceptance of this License with Oculus; and

2.4 The Oculus SDK includes a "LICENSE" text file (the "License Notice"), and any Oculus 
SDK distribution that you distribute must include a copy of this License with the License Notice.

OCULUS PLATFORM SERVICES

3. Oculus makes the headers, libraries and APIs, software, and other tools made available by 
Oculus to enable Platform Services in connection with your Developer Content. You agree 
not to use any API, code or other tools, instruction or service provided by Oculus to enable 
or use a Platform Service other than in compliance with these terms. For more information go 
to https://developer.oculus.com.

• "Oculus Platform Framework" means the suite of Oculus platform services, including but not 
  limited to the Oculus file distribution and update system (enabling distribution and updates 
  of Developer Content by Oculus, including through generated activation Keys), entitlement 
  system, and account authentication, which list may be changed from time to time in Oculus' 
  sole discretion.
• "Application Services" means services provided by Oculus associated with the Platform, 
  including but not limited to in-app purchasing, multiplayer matchmaking, friends, leader boards, 
  achievements, rooms, voice over IP and cloud saves, which list may be changed from time to time 
  in Oculus' sole discretion.
• "Platform" means the Oculus virtual reality platform, including but not limited to the user 
  experience, user interface, store, and social features, usable on Oculus approved hardware or 
  any third-party device or operating system, including but not limited to iOS, Android, Windows, 
  OS X, Linux, and Windows Mobile.
• "Platform Services" means the Oculus Platform Framework and the Application Services.

3.1 Oculus Platform Services. Oculus makes certain Platform Services available to you to include and 
enable in your Developer Content. Developer Content that enables or includes any Platform Service 
must implement the Oculus Platform Framework with that Developer Content. Once your Developer 
Content has been authorized for use of the Platform Services, you are not required to update your 
Developer Content to include new Platform Services Oculus may make available as part of the 
Oculus Platform Framework.

3.2 Limited Authorization. You hereby grant Oculus the limited authorization reasonably necessary 
for Oculus's exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under this Section 3. 
You agree that Oculus may use its contractors and affiliates for the purposes of exercising 
its rights and licenses set forth in this Section 3.

3.3. Internal Use. You agree that Oculus may grant its employees and internal contractors the 
right to use, perform and display the Developer Content you provide to Oculus for testing, 
evaluation and approval purposes, which shall be on a royalty-free basis.

3.4 Key Provision and Redemption. If you request that Oculus generate activation keys for your 
Developer Content on the Platform ("Keys") and Oculus agrees, you hereby grant Oculus (i) the 
right to generate Keys for you and (ii) a license to make available, reproduce, distribute, 
perform, and display the Developer Content to end users who have submitted a Key to Oculus. 
Oculus agrees to authenticate and make Developer Content available to any end user supplying 
a valid Key (unless the Developer Content has been removed or withdrawn).

3.5 Platform Services Requirements. You will not make any use of any API, software, code or 
other item or information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Services other 
than to enhance the functionality of your Developer Content. In particular, you must not 
(nor enable others to): (i) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others, or to promote or 
facilitate any prohibited or illegal activities; (ii) enable any functionality in your Developer 
Content that would generate excessive traffic over the Oculus network or servers that would 
negatively impact other users' experience, or otherwise interfere with or restrict the operation 
of the Platform Services, or Oculus's servers or networks providing the Platform Services; or 
(iii) remove, obscure, or alter any Oculus license terms, policies or terms of service or any 
links to or notices thereto. You may not sublicense any software, firmware or other item or 
information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Service for use by a third party, 
unless expressly authorized by Oculus to do so. You agree not to use (or encourage the use of) the 
Platform Services for mission critical, life saving or ultra-hazardous activities. Oculus may suspend 
operation of or remove any Developer Content that does not comply with the restrictions in this License.

You will not use the Oculus Avatar associated with the Oculus ID of any end user in your Developer 
Content without the express permission of that end user unless, (i) that end user is actively engaged 
with your Developer Content or (ii) that end user remains part of an active session of your Developer 
Content with whom other end users are interacting, whether or not that end user is then online.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

4. Additional Materials

4.1 Oculus may include in this Oculus SDK additional content (e.g., samples) for demonstration, references 
or other specific purposes. Such content will be clearly marked in the Oculus SDK and is subject to 
any included terms and conditions.

4.2 Your use of third-party materials included in the Oculus SDK may be subject to other terms and 
conditions typically found in separate third-party license agreements or "READ ME" files included with 
such third-party materials. To the extent such other terms and conditions conflict with the terms and 
conditions of this License, the former will control with respect to the applicable third-party materials.

5. THE OCULUS SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF, THE OCULUS HEADERS, LIBRARIES AND APIS, AND THE PLATFORM SERVICES 
FROM OCULUS AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE 
DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL OCULUS AS THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT 
OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON 
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS OCULUS SDK, THE OCULUS HEADERS, LIBRARIES AND APIS OR THE PLATFORM 
SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

6. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names 
of Oculus, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Oculus SDK, and 
reproducing the content of the License Notice file. Oculus reserves all rights not expressly granted to you 
under this License. Neither the name of Oculus VR, LLC nor the names of Oculus VR, LLC's contributors, licensors, 
employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote products developed using the Oculus SDK without 
specific prior written permission of Oculus VR, LLC.

7. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Oculus SDK and your Developer Content, including enabled 
Platform Services, complies with all applicable laws (including privacy laws) wherever your Developer Content is 
made available. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any health and safety issues arising 
from your Developer Content.  You will not collect end users' content or information, or otherwise access any Oculus 
site, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without Oculus' prior permission.

8. Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of itself and for all Developer Content created 
as of March 28, 2016, may be evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the Oculus SDK, or acceptance of the 
license agreement. As this License is updated for future releases of the Oculus SDK, you agree to abide by and meet 
all requirements of future updates of this License for those future Oculus SDK releases, with acceptance evidenced 
by usage of the Oculus SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License will apply for that future 
Developer Content that may be developed for or with that future Oculus SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot 
sidestep out of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against an older release of the Oculus 
SDK or License).

9. Oculus reserves the right to terminate this License and all your rights hereunder immediately in the event you 
materially breach this License.

10. Furthermore, Oculus also reserves the right to cancel or terminate this License for any of the following reasons:

a. Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content created by you that is used with or by the Oculus 
   SDK, or any of the Platform Services;
b. Developer Content (including enabling Platform Services) that violates applicable law;
c. Health and safety issues associated with your Developer Content;
d. Failure to comply with or use properly the Oculus Flash Screen Warnings;
e. Use of the Oculus SDK with a commercial product other than an Oculus Approved Product;
f. Failure to provide required notices as set forth above; and
g. Failure to observe the restrictions in Section 3.5.

11. You agree to fully indemnify Oculus from any and all losses, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable 
attorney's fees) arising out of your Developer Content or any matter set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 10(a) through (g).

12. Oculus may discontinue or change functionality of the Platform Services at any time, and your continued use of the 
Platform Services or use of any modified or additional Platform Services is conditioned upon your adherence to the terms 
of this License, as modified by Oculus from time to time.

13. In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a court or 
other body of competent jurisdiction, this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable 
provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable.

14. You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without the advance written consent of Oculus, 
which may be withheld in its sole discretion. Oculus may assign its rights or obligations under this License in its 
sole discretion.

15. Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this License will not be construed as a 
waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.

16. Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect money damages, if any, and you hereby 
waive your right to injunctive or other equitable relief.

17. You will comply, and will not cause Oculus to not comply (by for example, providing Developer Content to Oculus 
under this Agreement for which required export clearances have not been obtained), with all applicable export control 
laws of the United States and any other applicable governmental authority, including without limitation, the U.S. 
Export Administration Regulations. You agree that this License and the Oculus SDK and accompanying documentation are 
Oculus's confidential information (and is not publicly available), and you will not use it, disclose it or make it 
available to others except in accordance with the terms of this License.

18. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to choice of law principles. 
All disputes relating to this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration before a neutral 
arbitrator in Santa Clara, California. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures 
of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. You and Oculus agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara, 
California in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator's judgment or decision or any dispute with respect to the 
arbitration process or procedure or Oculus's exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.

Each party will use all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of all of the other party’s Confidential Information in its possession or control, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own Confidential Information of similar nature and importance. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information or the terms and conditions of this Agreement as required under applicable securities regulations or pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the party required to make such a disclosure (i) gives reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest such order or requirement prior to its disclosure (whether through protective orders or otherwise), (ii) uses reasonable effort to obtain confidential treatment or similar protection to the fullest extent possible to avoid public disclosure, and (iii) discloses only the minimum amount of information necessary to comply with such requirements.

Confidential Information does not and will not include information that:

(i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by the receiving party;
(ii) is rightfully known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality;
(iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or
(iv) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.

THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND NVIDIA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF OPERABILITY, CONDITION, VALUE, ACCURACY OF DATA, OR QUALITY, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, WORKMANSHIP, SUITABILITY, NON-INGRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE BY NVIDIA ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE. NVIDIA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.

THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY, THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS OR THE NUMBER OF PARTIES WITHIN YOUR ENTERPRISE THAT ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NVIDIA OR ITS LICENSORS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

7. TERM AND TERMINATION.

This Agreement and your licenses hereunder shall become effective upon the Effective Date and shall remain in effect unless and until terminated as follows: (i) automatically if you breach any of the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) by either party upon written notice if the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy or any proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or composition for the benefit of creditors, if that petition or proceeding is not dismissed with prejudice within sixty (60) days after filing, or if a party ceases to do business; (iii) by you, upon ceasing to use the Licensed Software provided under this Agreement; or (iv) by NVIDIA upon written notice if you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, with respect to the Licensed Software that is the subject of the proceeding during the pendency of such legal proceeding. Termination of this Agreement shall not release the parties from any liability which, at the time of termination, has already accrued or which thereafter may accrue with respect to any act or omission before termination, or from any obligation which is expressly stated in this Agreement to survive termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party terminating this Agreement shall incur no additional liability merely by virtue of such termination. Termination of this Agreement regardless of cause or nature shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the parties and shall be without liability for any loss or damage occasioned thereby. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement (i) you must promptly discontinue use of the Licensed Software, and (ii) you must promptly destroy or return to NVIDIA all copies of the Licensed Software and all portions thereof in your possession or control, and each party will promptly destroy or return to the other all of the other party’s Confidential Information within its possession or control, provided that your prior distributions in accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your obligations under this section. Sections 2 through 8 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

8. MISCELLANEOUS.

8.1 NVIDIA Entities. NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, NVIDIA Singapore Pte Ltd., have agreed to their respective rights and obligations regarding the distribution of the Licensed Software and the performance of obligations related to the Licensed Software. Ordering and delivery shall be with the NVIDIA entity with distribution rights for the geographic region in which the Licensed Software will be used, as communicated by NVIDIA to you.

8.2 Audit. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, you will maintain complete and accurate books and records regarding use of the Licensed Software and your performance and administration of this Agreement. During such period and upon written notice to you, NVIDIA or its authorized third party auditors subject to confidentiality obligations will have the right to inspect and audit your Enterprise books and records for the purpose of confirming your compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any such inspection and audit will be conducted during regular business hours, in a manner that minimizes interference with your normal business activities, and no more frequent than annually unless non-compliance was previously found. If such an inspection and audit reveals an underpayment of any amounts payable to NVIDIA, then you will promptly remit the full amount of such underpayment to NVIDIA, including interest that will accrue (without the requirement of a notice) at the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permissible by law. If the underpaid amount exceeds five percent (5%) of the amounts payable to NVIDIA for the period audited and/or such an inspection and audit reveals a material non-conformance with the terms of this Agreement, then you will also pay NVIDIA’s reasonable costs of conducting the inspection and audit. Further, you agree that the party delivering the Licensed Software to you may collect and disclose to NVIDIA (subject to confidentiality obligations) information for NVIDIA to verify your compliance with the terms of this Agreement including (without limitation) information regarding your usage of the Licensed Software.

8.3 Trademarks. You are granted no rights to use any of NVIDIA's trademarks under this Agreement.

8.5 Injunctive Relief. The parties agree that a breach of any of the promises or agreements contained in this Agreement may result in irreparable and continuing injury for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and therefore the parties are entitled to seek injunctive relief as well as such other and further relief as may be appropriate.

8.6 Waiver. The failure by either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or any other right. Any waiver will be effective only if in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of each party.

8.7 Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned by you, in whole or in part, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, or any other manner, without written consent of NVIDIA, and any purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be void and of no effect. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement, and each is solely responsible for all of its employees, agents, contractors, and labor costs and expenses arising in connection therewith.

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work 
to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed. 

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then 
  any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the 
  attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
  that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of 
  the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the

  with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
  Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
  License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

  provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
  modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License. 

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. 

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole

CC0 1.0 Universal

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
