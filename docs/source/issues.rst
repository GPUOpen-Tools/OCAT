Known Issues
=============

UPlay
-----

The overlay does not work with UPlay games due to security mechanisms. This applies both for the global and the direct hook. Recording function, thus, works fine.


Steam: DOOM and Wolfenstein
---------------------------

The direct hook for the overlay does not work due to a relaunch of the game by Steam. However, the global hook for the overlay and the recording function work.


SteamVR: Battlezone
-------------------

For the HMD overlay, the global hook does not work. Use the direct hook for enabling the overlay within the HMD. Recordings are fine.
